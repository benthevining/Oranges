Oranges is a library of CMake modules.

Oranges provides some helper targets, some wrapper functions around native CMake modules to provide higher-level and more convenient APIs, and some additional functionality that is not present in the modules CMake ships. Oranges also provides a few standalone scripts to perform tasks related to management of CMake files.
